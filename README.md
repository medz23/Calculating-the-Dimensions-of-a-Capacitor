# Calculating-the-Dimensions-of-a-Water-Based Condenser
It's a tool for correcting student's projects, you can calculate the right values in a few seconds.

The project was guided by Professor Apostol Valentin. 

I've used Math's functions in JavaScript.

This calculator needs some initial data that you can obtain by doing thermodynamic calculations depending on the refrigerants you use, these needed values can be calculated in specialized programs such as EES.
After entering the data you can see if the data you get suits you and modify it so as to give the best possible result with the most accurate initial data.
Before creating this program for such a project it took many hours, but now you can dimension with water-based condenser in a few seconds.
